            <p>Hi! My name is Erick Hurtado, I'm from Mexico City but I'm actually linving in Mexico State (yup, Mexico is the only country I know that has both a city and a state called Mexico). I'm 21 years old, and I really enjoy playing the guitar, playing basketball and videogames. I am someone who enjoys trying new things, and I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Software Development. I look forward to learn more and enjoy more in life.</p>
